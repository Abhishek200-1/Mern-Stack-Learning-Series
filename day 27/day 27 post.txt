🌟 Day 27: Mastering JavaScript Operators & Conditionals 💻

🔥 Today’s Tutorial Highlights:
In this video, we explored the power of JavaScript Operators and the magic of Conditionals that make our programs smart and interactive! 🧠✨

🎯 What Are Operators?
Operators are symbols or keywords that help us perform actions on data. Let’s break them down:

Operator Type	     Description					Example
Arithmetic	     Perform basic math operations (+, -, *, /, %)	5 + 3 = 8
Assignment	     Assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)	x = 10; x += 5; // x = 15
Comparison	     Compare two values (==, ===, !=, >, <, >=, <=)	10 > 5 // true
Logical	             Combine conditions (&&,	
Ternary	             Shorthand for if-else (condition ? true : false)	5 > 3 ? "Yes" : "No"

✨ Example:

let a = 10, b = 20;
console.log(a + b); // 30 (Arithmetic)
console.log(a > b); // false (Comparison)
console.log(a === 10 && b === 20); // true (Logical)

🎯 What Are Conditionals?
Conditionals allow your code to make decisions based on specific conditions. Let’s dive into the main types:

1️⃣ if Statement:
Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult!");
}

2️⃣ if-else Statement:
Adds an alternate action if the condition is false.

let score = 45;
if (score >= 50) {
  console.log("Pass");
} else {
  console.log("Fail");
}

3️⃣ else if Ladder:
Tests multiple conditions in sequence.

let marks = 85;
if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A+");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: B");
}

4️⃣ Switch Statement:
Used for multiple options based on a single variable.

let day = "Monday";
switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("Start of the week!");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("Almost weekend!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Just another day.");
}

✨ What We Learned Today:
	•	How to use operators to perform calculations, assign values, and make comparisons. 🛠
	•	How to use conditional statements (if, else, else if, and switch) to control program flow. 🧩
