👩‍💻 Day 2 of My Web Development Journey 👨‍💻

Today, I took my first official steps in coding by learning the fundamentals of web development! 🚀 This session introduced me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the core building blocks of the web. Here’s what I covered:

🔹 Environment Setup: Installed Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and learned how to set up a coding environment with the right extensions for HTML. 🛠️

🔹 Writing My First Code: Created a basic ‘Hello World’ program in HTML and ran it using the Live Server extension. Such a simple start, but it feels empowering! 🙌

🔹 HTML Comments: Learned to use HTML comments to keep my code organized and clean. This might be small, but it’s a crucial part of building maintainable code! 📄

I’m following a comprehensive web development course on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that takes me from the basics of HTML/CSS to advanced JavaScript frameworks. 💻 This is only the beginning, and I can’t wait to keep building my skills day by day!
