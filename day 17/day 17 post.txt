🌟 Day 17: Exploring CSS Media Queries & Custom Variables! 🌟

Today, I stepped into the world of dynamic web design 🌐 with two incredible tools: CSS Media Queries and Custom Variables! 🚀 These concepts are essential for crafting responsive, adaptable, and modern websites.

🔹 CSS Media Queries: Building Responsiveness 📱
🖥️ Media Queries allow us to design for multiple screen sizes, from desktops to tablets to mobile devices.
📏 Breakpoints: Define specific conditions (like max-width, min-width) to apply tailored styles.
📱 Customize layouts, font sizes, and visibility for a seamless user experience across all devices.
💡 Example: Creating mobile-friendly menus and grid-based layouts that adapt like magic!

🔹 CSS Custom Variables: Dynamic Styling Made Simple 🎨
💾 Custom Variables (CSS variables) let us define reusable values for colors, fonts, spacing, and more.
🔄 Flexibility: Update styles globally by modifying a single variable—no repetitive edits!
🌈 Example: Changing a theme's primary color across an entire site with just one tweak.
🛠️ Syntax:

:root {  
    --primary-color: #4CAF50;  
    --font-size: 16px;  
}  
body {  
    color: var(--primary-color);  
    font-size: var(--font-size);  
}  

🔹 Why This Matters:
CSS Media Queries ensure your websites look stunning on any screen size 📱💻, while Custom Variables empower you to create maintainable and scalable code 🛠️. These tools are game-changers for modern web development! 💪
