🎬 Day 9 of My Web Development Journey: Media & Modern HTML Elements! 🎬

Today, I leveled up my web development skills by working with media tags and modern HTML elements! It was amazing to see how these elements can bring a website to life and enhance user experience. Here’s what I covered:

🔹 Incorporating Multimedia: Learned to add images, audio, and video elements, creating a richer, more engaging interface. 📸🎶📹

🔹 Embedding Content with Iframe: Explored the versatile <iframe> tag for embedding external content like videos and maps directly on a webpage. 🌐

🔹 Using Modern HTML Tags: Practiced structuring with tags like <header>, <footer>, <main>, and <aside>, making the layout more accessible and intuitive. 📑

Each tag adds new dimensions to my project, and I’m excited about the potential for more interactive and structured designs! This journey through HTML has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m thrilled to keep pushing forward! 🚀
