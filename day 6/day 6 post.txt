📊 Day 6 of My Web Development Journey 📊

Today was all about HTML tables and their powerful role in creating structured, organized layouts for web pages! 🚀 Here’s what I explored:

🔹 Core Table Elements: Learned the essentials—<table>, <tr>, <td>, <th>, <thead>, <tfoot>, and <tbody>—to build tables that are both organized and accessible. 📐

🔹 Advanced Features: Mastered colspan and rowspan to merge cells and span rows/columns, enabling more complex and customized table designs. 🧩

🔹 Practice Makes Perfect: Worked through three hands-on exercises to solidify my understanding and practical skills in building HTML tables! 🛠️

This web development course on the MERN stack is packed with practical techniques that make every session engaging and incredibly useful. 📈 Each day brings new insights and capabilities—excited to keep pushing forward!
