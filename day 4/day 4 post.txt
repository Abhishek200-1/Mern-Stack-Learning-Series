🌟 Day 4 of My Web Development Journey 🌟

Today was all about mastering HTML tags—a fundamental part of building web pages! 📄 I explored the different types of tags and learned how they bring structure, meaning, and accessibility to web content. Here’s a breakdown of what I covered:

🔹 Semantic Tags: Understanding tags like <header>, <footer>, and <section> that add meaning and improve accessibility. 🌍

🔹 Structural and Formatting Tags: Learned how to use structural tags to shape layouts and formatting tags like <strong> and <em> to make content stand out. 🏗️

🔹 Tags vs. Elements: Finally, I clarified the difference between tags (the written code) and elements (the rendered result), which is key to writing clean, correct HTML. ✅

🔹 Attributes: Explored how attributes like class and id add custom styling and interactivity to HTML, making elements more dynamic and flexible. 🎯

This is part of a comprehensive MERN stack course that’s taking me from HTML basics to advanced JavaScript frameworks, and I’m thrilled with each new skill I’m picking up! 🚀
