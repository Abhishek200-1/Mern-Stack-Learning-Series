🎨 Day 11 of My Web Development Journey: Diving into CSS Basics! 🎨

Today, I began exploring CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the language that gives web pages their visual flair! Here’s what I learned:

🔹 CSS Fundamentals: Gained insight into how CSS controls the appearance and layout of web pages 🎉.

🔹 Styling Approaches:

Inline CSS: Quick styling within HTML tags ✏️.
Internal Stylesheets: Defined styles in the <head> section for a single page 📄.
External Stylesheets: Reusable CSS files for consistent styling across multiple pages 🌐.
🔹 Selectors: Practiced using different selectors to precisely target elements for customized styling 🎯.

CSS has opened up endless possibilities for creating visually appealing and engaging websites, and I can’t wait to style up some pages! 💻💪
