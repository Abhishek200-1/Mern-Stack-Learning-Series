🌐 Understanding How the Internet Works! 🌐

Today, I dove into an essential topic in my web development journey — how the internet actually works! 📶 It’s foundational for anyone stepping into web development because it explains the backbone of how websites and web applications function. Here’s a bit of what I covered:

🔹 History of the Internet: From its early days to becoming the global network we rely on today.

🔹 Data Transmission Basics: How data travels across the internet, including protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP that make everything work seamlessly.

🔹 Practical Takeaways: A clearer understanding of how websites connect and communicate, setting me up for more advanced development topics. 🚀

This was all part of a comprehensive web development course I’m following, covering everything from HTML/CSS basics to advanced JavaScript frameworks. I’m excited to keep learning and sharing as I go! 📈

If you're curious or just getting started, stay tuned and join me on this journey—there’s so much to explore in the world of web development! 💻
