🖥️ Day 3 of My Web Development Journey 🖥️

Today was all about diving into the world of HTML tags and learning how they bring structure and meaning to web pages! 🌐 This session deepened my understanding of HTML and its role in creating accessible and well-organized sites. Here’s what I covered:

🔹 HTML Tags: Explored the semantic, structural, and formatting tags that help define the layout and meaning of content. 🏗️

🔹 Tags vs. Elements: Learned the difference between tags (the code we write) and elements (the rendered content). This distinction is key for writing accurate and efficient HTML! 📄

🔹 Attributes: Discovered how attributes add extra info to tags, like adding class or id to style elements and make them interactive. These are the "power-ups" of HTML! 🎮

This journey is part of a comprehensive MERN stack course, covering everything from the basics of HTML and CSS to advanced JavaScript frameworks. Each day brings new insights, and I’m excited to keep growing my skills! 🚀
